//  RelayConfig — V4. Support for routing TMDB/IGDB requests through
//  Patrick's relay server instead of calling TMDB/IGDB directly. When
//  enabled, the app never needs its own TMDB/IGDB credentials at all —
//  the relay holds the real ones and injects them server-side. See
//  tmdbscraper.cpp's getJson() and igdbscraper.cpp's postToIgdb() for
//  where this actually gets used.
//
//  BOTH DEFAULTS BELOW ARE DELIBERATELY BLANK in this public source.
//
//  RELAY_SHARED_SECRET_DEFAULT is a password — it is what lets an app
//  authenticate to a relay — and a password committed to a public repo
//  is a password everyone has. So there isn't one here.
//
//  With both blank, RelayConfig::isConfigured() answers false and the app
//  never calls a relay at all. It still works: TV comes from TVmaze, which
//  needs no credentials of any kind. To get movies and games as well you
//  have two choices, and README.md walks through both —
//
//    • put your own TMDB key / IGDB credentials in Settings, and the app
//      calls those services directly, no relay involved; or
//    • run the relay server yourself (its source is public too) and enter
//      its address and secret in Settings → Network → Relay Key.
//
//  If you are building a private fork for yourself, you can paste your own
//  values below instead of typing them into Settings — just don't commit
//  the file afterwards, for the reason above.

    //    credentials are configured (0 or 1 of the two): each service
    //    independently uses ITS OWN credential if it has one,
    //    regardless of the "Use Media Countdowns Server" checkbox — a service
    //    with no credential falls back to the checkbox instead (relay
    //    if checked; if unchecked, it simply has no data source and
    //    will fail, by design — the checkbox is a real, meaningful
    //    choice, not just a suggestion).
    //  - If BOTH are configured: the checkbox becomes the sole,
    //    authoritative switch for BOTH services at once — checked
    //    forces relay for both (ignoring the saved credentials
    //    entirely), unchecked forces direct for both.

    // making up a UUID. Two reasons:

    //  1. Only a signed id counts as an installation, which is what stops the
    //     count being inflated by anything that happens to send an
    //     X-Client-ID header. The dashboard read 22 installations when one
    //     person had ever run the app, because every throwaway value used
    //     while debugging registered as one.
    //  2. An id edited by hand doesn't verify, so it is refused and replaced
    //     with a fresh one — nobody can graft themselves onto someone else's
    //     id, deliberately or by copying a config around.
    //
    // Stored in TWO places and read from whichever still has it:
    //
    //  • a hidden file under the user's profile, outside the app's own data
    //    directory, so it survives an uninstall/reinstall and isn't sitting
    //    next to tiles.json where it could be deleted during a clear-out
